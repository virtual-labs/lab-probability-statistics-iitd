  "introduction": "Probability and Statistics are foundational disciplines in mathematics and data science, essential for analysing uncertainty, making predictions, and drawing inferences from data. These fields have applications across various domains, including finance, engineering, health sciences, social sciences, and artificial intelligence.</br></br> The Probability and Statistics Virtual Lab provides an interactive environment for students, researchers, and professionals to explore and grasp both the basic principles and advanced concepts of probability and statistics. Through dynamic simulations and experiments, users can model real-world scenarios, observe statistical behaviours, and analyse data using techniques like hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and probability distributions.</br></br> This virtual lab empowers users to experiment with diverse data sets, statistical methods, and probability models, enhancing their ability to visualize complex concepts and understand the impact of different variables and assumptions on outcomes.",
